# Datamatics-Hackathon

The final project is in the file named assembled.py.

3 json files are to be used as well.

The client_secret.json is the google OAuth2.0 file which you will get onece you complete the google authorization of the email you wish to use.
(Note : Save the name of the jason file as client_secret.json for the program to work)

The gmail_token.json is the key for using the Gmail API provided by google.

The visionAPI_token.json is the key to use vision API in the program.

This program is the complete backend program for it to be used anywhere eg. in a website or an app. 
The only things user needs to take care of is to get the authorization and the tokens to make the prgram workable.
